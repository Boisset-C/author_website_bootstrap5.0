            <p>
              Jamie W. Smith grew up in Ferrum, VA and attended Franklin County
              High. She would countinue her education at Liberty University and
              graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. After Liberty,
              Jamie would attend James Madison University and graduate with her
              Masters as a Family Nurse Practitioner. As a loving wife, and
              mother of two, Jamie seeks to add equity to her prefession and
              surrounding community. Starting out as a NP, Jamie struggled to
              find resources for clinical practice that were not overwhelming.
              As she would train new healthcare providers, they would ask for
              copies of her work. This would lead Jamie to take the next step
              and consider publishing her efforts. With the help of physician
              Dr. Bradley J. Goad, Jamie would go on to author Geriatric Notes.

              As a newer practitioner, I found myself carrying around several
              books with me for reference. It was tiring carrying all those
              books but now I've replaced them with this one. Very concise and
              to the point. You get common symptoms, diagnostic criteria, and
              first line treatments. I also enjoyed the "clinical pearls" at the
              end of the sections. It's nice to travel lighter but still feel
              like you have a good reference to fall back on.

              "[Geriatric Notes] is a must-have resource for every practitioner,
              new or current, because it defines specifically the steps

              patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease, tremors, dementia,
              delusions, cerebrovascular accidents, and much more. This handy
              guide provides all of the commonly used, but rarely memorized
              information you need—from definitions, causes, risk factors,
              symptoms, to tests and assessment, treatment and comprehensive
              management, making it easy to navigate."
